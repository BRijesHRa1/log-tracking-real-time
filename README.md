# Real-Time Log Tracking

Real-Time Log Tracking is a robust solution designed to monitor, collect, and visualize application logs as they happen. This project enables developers and system administrators to gain instant insights into application behavior, errors, and performance through a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Instantly view logs as they are generated.
- **Centralized Log Collection:** Aggregate logs from multiple sources in one place.
- **Search & Filter:** Quickly find relevant log entries using powerful search and filter options.
- **Customizable Alerts:** Set up notifications for specific log patterns or errors.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Easily adapts to growing log volumes and multiple applications.

## Technology Stack

This project leverages industry-standard open-source tools for log aggregation, monitoring, and visualization:

- **Loki:** A horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. Loki is designed to be cost-effective and easy to operate, focusing on indexing only metadata rather than the full log content.
- **Prometheus:** An open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. Prometheus scrapes and stores metrics as time series data, providing powerful querying and alerting capabilities.
- **Grafana:** An open-source analytics and interactive visualization web application. Grafana connects to Loki and Prometheus to provide rich dashboards and real-time log/metric visualization.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-log-tracking.git
cd real-time-log-tracking
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the Application

Start the development server:

```sh
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your configuration).

## Usage

1. **Configure Log Sources:** Set up your applications to send logs to the tracking server.
2. **Monitor Logs:** Use the web interface to view, search, and analyze logs in real time.
3. **Set Alerts:** Configure alerts for critical events or errors.
